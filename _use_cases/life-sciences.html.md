## The challenge

Discovering new drugs is immensely complex and expensive. How can the chances of finding new drugs be improved by technology?

## The solution

Weaviate looks at the existing library of biologically active compounds (BACs) both in your data and in publicly available databases. It can then use structure data to map known existing BACs to similarly shaped molecules and compounds which flags up potential research areas. Weaviate finds the potential candidates for you in the available data and can be trained to narrow down to specific fields of study
