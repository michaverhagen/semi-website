## The challenge

"Smart" buildings have many sensors and data sources which work in groups but don't work as a whole. For example the turnstile data is not connected with the heating system.

## The solution

Efficiencies can be made throughout a building that take advantage of all the sensors and combine them to a knowledge graph of the entire building information network. With this information all the IOT devices and other sensor-equipped machinery can work together as a whole for problem solving, cost effectiveness and maximizing the quality of the environment. Temperature control: Reducing the heating or increasing the cooling based on historical, weather and turnstile data. Safety: combining turnstile data, fire alarms, door responders, movement detectors etc. to establish how quickly and if a building is empty during an emergency.
