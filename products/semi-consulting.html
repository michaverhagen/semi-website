                        <p>The power of Weaviate is greatly enhanced by its ability to combine different data sources, even  where no shared common structure of the information exists. We help you to first identify the key data sources that are most likely to contain the information needed for your use cases. We will also help you identify gaps in your data and assist you in making sources available to you that lie outside of your organization.</p>
