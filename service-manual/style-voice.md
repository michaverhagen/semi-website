# Voices
We have 2 voices which are named after their audience.
- Voice 1: _Contributor_ Programmers and other technical people
- Voice 2: _User_ Business people, probably non-technical

Our ideal is that no technical language gets into the User documents. If it does you will need to explain the technical terms.

Keep it brief - we are all short of time - try to compress your words to a level where they are still clear 

Blaise Pascale probably said it first (in 1657):
> I have made this longer than usual because I have not had time to make it shorter.  

It takes a little time but it is worth it.
