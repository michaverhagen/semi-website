		<h2>SeMI style guide and our voice</h2>

		<section class="style-sm-section">
			<h3>Voice and Tone</h3>
			<p>First of all: keep it brief - we are all short of time - try to minimize your words so they are brief and still clear. It takes a little time but it is worth it.</p>
			<p>Blaise Pascale probably said it first (in 1657):</p>
			<blockquote><p>I have made this longer than usual because I have not had time to make it shorter.</p></blockquote>
			<p>There are a lot of style guides in the world and if you have ever done some writing you have probably used them. If you are an experienced writer you don’t need the majority of the advice, if you are new it is pretty handy.
			Here are some well-constructed guides</p>
			<ul>
			<li><a href="https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/voice-and-tone/">Mailchimp</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://alistapart.com/about/style-guide/">A list apart</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://gathercontent.com/blog/voice-tone-style-whys-wheres-hows/">Gather content</a></li>

			<p>And it is worth reading the below for a different perspective</p>
			<li><a href="https://medium.com/@JJFoxBox/you-dont-need-a-voice-tone-style-guide-53e9a11f3d36">Medium</a></li></ul>

			<p>If you are an experienced writer you don’t need the guide, you need the more technical part and the glossary for standardization.</p>

			<h4>Best practices for SeMI documents</h4>

			<p>Whatever your level of writing skill keep these things in mind:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Excellent: we do our best</li>
			<li>Concise: we don’t waste the reader’s time</li>
			<li>Clear: we don’t hide behind long polysyllabic words and flowery language</li>
			<li>Active: we use phrases like “load the file” and do not use “the file should be loaded”</li>
			<li>Consistent: we use the same voice and elements to build trust and ease reading</li>
			<li>Dynamic: our writing flows and is not dull</li>
			<li>Progressive: everything can be improved, there is always a next version that is better</li>
			<li>Diverse: inclusive, global, thoughtful, considerate</li>
			</ul>
			<p><em>These points represent us – we use them  in our writing to show the personality of SeMI</em></p>
			<h2>Voices</h2>
			<p>We have 2 voices which are named after their audience</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Voice 1: <em>Contributor</em> Programmers and other technical people</li>
				<li>Voice 2: <em>User</em> Business people, probably non-technical</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Our ideal is that no technical language gets into the User documents. If it does you will need to explain the technical terms.</p>

<h3>Nuts and bolts: practical details for each document</h3>
<h4>Format of document sections</h4>
<p>Title: All Initial Capitals</p>
<p>Headings: Initial capital only</p>
<p>All documents have the same set of potential building blocks. Some are mandatory. You don't always have to use the name of the section - sometimes it is more useful to use a different or more descriptive word. The full list is</p>
